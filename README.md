It's just a backup for me. Don't use this.

Intended use:
- Configure config.d/combine-keys
- When installing, instead of letting the installer create the luks devices, use `make installation-initialize`
- At the end of the installation, run `make initrd` in your new system (after chrooting if necessary)
